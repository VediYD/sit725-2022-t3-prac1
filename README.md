## About

Hi! I have used this markdown to record the steps taken to complete the task. I'll keep updating this markdown to summarize what I have done for each week.

## Steps taken

### Week 1

1. Initialized `https://github.com/VediYD/sit725-2022-t3-prac1`.<br>Repository link: [sit725-2022-t3-prac1](https://github.com/VediYD/sit725-2022-t3-prac1)
2. Created the `LICENSE` file and the `README.md` file.
3. Cloned the project using `git clone https://github.com/VediYD/sit725-2022-t3-prac1.git` on local system.
4. Opened project in VSCode.
5. Created folder `./js`.
6. Initialized `./js/scripts.js`
7. Created folder `./css`
8. Initialized `./css/style.css`
9. Initialized `./index.html`
10. Updated `./index.html` code. Formatted the html using Prettier(extension) using key `lshift` + `lalt` + `f`. Tested by launching Live Server(extension).
